- 👋 Hi, I’m @collindavies. I'm a scientist. More than that, I've got an interest in creating right-sized solutions to really challenging and important problems.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing tools to better manage precious resources like water, time, and money.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new computational and statistical tools like Python, machine learning, and intuititive and insightful ways to present data and results.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on water resource management projects and just about anything else :)
